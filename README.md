# Crime-Data-Analysis
This Power BI project presents a comprehensive Crime Analysis Report, developed to derive actionable insights from a dataset comprising over 2,500 crime records. The report focuses on evaluating the total number of crimes, tracking their year-over-year distribution, and visualizing the monthly and weekly patterns using interactive visuals such as line charts and heatmaps. One of the core objectives was to assess crime trends over time, including time-specific analyses like incidents occurring between 3:00 AM to 5:59 AM, enabling stakeholders to identify vulnerable time windows. A country-wise comparison of crime frequencies was also implemented to understand regional variances, while visual KPIs highlighted monthly crime fluctuations along with percentage variances, offering a clear view of rising or declining patterns.

Additionally, the report delves into crime resolution patterns by distinguishing between resolved and unresolved cases, providing insights into law enforcement efficiency. A detailed examination of crime types, based on a second dataset containing 12 classifications, adds granularity to the findings. The most notable outcome was the identification of the most dangerous times of day, helping to guide security planning and awareness efforts. By integrating both quantitative data and intuitive visuals, this project not only supports strategic decision-making but also serves as a robust analytical tool for public safety and law enforcement optimization. The use of Power BIâ€™s slicers, filters, DAX measures, and visualizations brings the dataset to life, allowing users to interactively explore and interpret crime patterns.
